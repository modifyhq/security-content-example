description: Principal policy on information security. 
---

## Background

This is the principal policy on information security. It is supported by a number of lower level policies, procedures, and records that document what we do to achieve the security objectives defined here.

## Objectives

- Define security objectives
- Outline security approach
- Roles and responsibilities
- Establish importance of improvement

## Scope

This policy covers everything in scope of the information security management system (ISMS).

## Definitions

- **Information** - content stored in electronic (e.g. data, credentials, business processes), physical (e.g. paper) or intangible (e.g. know how) form and transmitted via electronic, physical or verbal (or other intangible) means.
- **Information security** - preservation of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all information.
  - **Confidentiality** - information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes.
  - **Integrity** - information is accurate and complete.
  - **Availability** - information is accessible and usable upon demand by an authorised person or entity.
  - **CIA** - confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- **Information security management system (ISMS)** - a framework for achieving the organisation's security objectives. It includes security objectives, controlled documents (policies, procedures and records) that describe controls, and resources and activities required to implement them.

## Policy

### Why is security important?
<Link artifactId="iso27001/5.2" kind="implements" />

The success of our business is underpinned by trust. Trust can be built with stakeholders in a variety of ways, but one of the most important is keeping their information secure.

The legal, regulatory and contractual sources of this requirement are described in the [isms-requirements-record].

The consequences of poor security can be damaging to a business - national regulators in the EU have powers under GDPR to mete out large financial penalties, breach of contract claims, and reputational damage incurred can lead to significant loss of revenue and, in extreme cases, bankruptcy.

In so far as good security helps us build trust with clients and other stakeholders, it is a key priority for our business.

### Security objectives
<Link artifactId="iso27001/5.1" kind="implements" />

We have defined security objectives in support of our strategic goals to deliver value to clients. Each objective has associated metrics and target values and progress is measured by evaluating actual against target values.

| ID | Description | Rationale | Metric & target value | Owner |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 1 | Safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of customer data | Customers must be able to trust us with their data | Max of 0 major nonconformities & 10 minor nonconformities in any internal or external audit | Security Officer |
| 2 | Comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards | We must abide by the law. Failing to do so would undermine customer trust | Certificate for compliance with ISO27001:2013 issued by an independent auditor | Privacy Officer |
| 3 | Continually improve how we manage risk | Security is an ongoing task we must improve proactively | 100% of recommended actions for major/minor nonconformities in audits implemented within three months | Security Officer |
| 4 | High employee engagement with security | Employee education and ownership of security is the route to implementing an effective ISMS | Greater than 90% attendance to infosec training, no more than 25% of audit nonconformities in the people category, | Privacy Officer |

Security objectives are reviewed by the Security and Privacy Officers at the management review (see [management-review-procedure]).

### Approach
<Link artifactId="iso27001/5.1" kind="implements" />

We have created an information security management system (ISMS) to systemically manage the security risks to valuable information that complies with [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html).

This information is stored in digital and physical artifacts. How these artifacts are managed is described in the [artifact-management-policy].

Our core activity as a software company is making software. The process we use to do this is described in the [software-development-lifecycle-policy]. This policy also describes how we integrate security into the software development lifecycle. The key to this is risk management.

At different stages of the software lifecycle, we perform risk assessments to identify, analyse and evaluate risks, and then plan and implement mitigations to reduce them down to acceptable levels.

This process is described in the [risk-management-policy]. Day-to-day, however, this activity happens as a normal part of the software development lifecycle.

### Our commitment
<Link artifactId="iso27001/5.1, iso27001/5.2, iso27001/7.1" kind="implements" />

To show our commitment to meeting our security objectives and the requirements of our ISMS, we have created the roles of Privacy, Security and Compliance Officers to provide leadership and expertise in important areas of our ISMS. You can read more about these roles, who holds them and how to contact them in the [roles-and-responsibilities-register].

Besides this, we will ensure security work is given prominence at different levels of the business, and resourcing in terms of time and budgets are allocated to support our efforts.

### Your responsibilities
<Link artifactId="iso27001/5.1, iso27001/5.3, iso27001/7.3" kind="implements" />

The success of our security efforts depends on you - the ISMS will help us achieve our security objectives only if *you* are engaged, aligned and proactive.

The [roles-and-responsibilities-register] describes security roles and responsibilities, and what you need to be doing to ensure the success of the ISMS.

### Resources
<Link artifactId="iso27001/A.5.1.1" kind="implements" />

If you're not familiar with details of the ISMS or how you fit into it, don't worry, we've created some resources to help:

- All of our policies, procedures, records, audits and other useful ISMS information can be found on our internal docs site
- We run training sessions on various aspects of the ISMS.

The best way to use these is as part of your job. When you find yourself doing something that touches on a policy or procedure, read it, follow it where necessary, and help us improve it if you don't think it's quite right yet.

### Continual improvement
<Link artifactId="iso27001/5.1, iso27001/5.2" kind="implements" />

Compliance is often a dirty word, but it needn't be. We've spent time designing policies and procedures to help you do security as a natural, and hopefully low friction, part of your job.

We don't always get it right, though, and encourage you to help us improve. Continual improvement is a key part of our approach, and if you have ideas for how can we can do this, great!

Send all your ideas to the Privacy, Security or Compliance Officers.
