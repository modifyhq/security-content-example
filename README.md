# Information security

## Why information security?

Certification against security frameworks like ISO 27001 is a common requirement for technology companies. 

This involves designing and implementing a system for managing risks to information assets know as an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

As part of this, lots of documentation must be prepared for internal teams and external auditors. Usually this is time consuming and fraught with challenges. 

## Challenges 

Common challenges preparing security docs include:

- Poor version control, both for policies and tabular data
- Lack of traceability between requirements and controls
- Difficulty outputting to multiple formats for different stakeholders
- Poor access to content relevant for modern teams.

## Why Modify?

Modify solves these challenges in a few ways:

- Policies are written in markdown or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and stored in Git repositories for proper version control
- Registers make it easy to capture tabular data stored as text and version controlled just like your policies
- Relationships let you map requirements in standards to policies so you can evidence compliance easily
- Jobs makes it easy for you to render artifacts to PDF, HTML, or whatever format your stakeholders need
- Example content helps modern teams bootstrap their journeys to compliance.

## Docs 

This repo contains a selection of policies and procedures commonly required for an ISO 27001-compliant ISMS. 

We recommend you start with the [information-security-policy] for a high-level introduction and the [document-management-policy] for details on how the docs are organised.

## Registers 

Tabular data are a key part of your ISMS. You'll need tables of risks, assets, mappings to standards, suppliers... the list is long.

## Traceability

To visualise traceability between policies, risks and ISO 27001 requirements, use the relationships graph in the repository (click the relationships icon on the right side of your repository).
